  //To call the class "ExpenseItem" & the argument defined here i.e. "expense"
  //we need to define the above constructor in such a way so that argument
  //"expense" is a position argument & "super.key" is a named argument.
  //With above format you can call "ExpenseItem(expenses[index])" from another
  //file & get the data. Else there will be an error if "expense" is not a
  //position argument.
  //
  //In case you are calling a final argument, in the above line you need to
  //add: "required this.argument".
  //We can write the above as :
  //const ExpenseItem(this.expense, {super.key});
  //Here the first argument is a position argument, so don't require an
  //annotation viz. "required" before it.
  //The second argument i.e. "super.key" is a named parameter & hence within
  //a curly braces.
